# Redis-powered Job Queue with Pub-Sub Notifications

## Overview
This project implements a simple job queue system using Redis, Express.js, and Node.js. It consists of a master component that receives and enqueues jobs, and a worker component that processes these jobs. The system is designed to handle code execution tasks in Python and JavaScript. Additionally, it now includes a pub-sub model for real-time job completion notifications.
